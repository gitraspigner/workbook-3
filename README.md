### üìù Description
Contains a collection of my starter-level java exercise solutions from week 3. <br>
The workbook (PDF) containing most of the exercises from the week cannot be uploaded due to Pluralsight ownership rights. <br>
The instructor's versions of these workbook exercises can be found [here](https://github.com/BrightBoost/learningjava/tree/main/src/main/java/com/pluralsight/week3) (given that the repo is still active) <br>
Last I had checked (10/07/2025), there was NOT a directory created for extra exercises (which would have been within: **exercises \ week 3**). <br>

### üí≠ My Thoughts
-In Progress- <br>
- The first commit for each repo should just include the project config files. The second commit should include the inital project code file(s). <br>
I made a mistake in this repo by including them both in the same inital commit, so I'll have to be careful not to make it again.
- Instead of using "Adding", "Updating", etc for the verbiage of my commits, I'd prefer to start using "Add", "Update", etc to match what Github shows me by default when adding commits to my README files. <br>
I think this will prepare me to use more uniform language which many other professionals have adapted to using (I think).

#### üîñ Citation
I wrote this README.md, but I did indeed use ChatGPT to give my initial framework and to learn markdown formatting. Therefore here is an APA Style Citation for it:  <br>
OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Oct 1 version) [Large language model]. https://chatgpt.com/ <br>

*I have to give credit where it's due, right?* <br>
