### üìù Description
Contains a collection of my starter-level java exercise solutions from week 3. <br>
The majority of the exercise writeups can be found [here](https://github.com/BrightBoost/learningjava) (given that the repo is still active) <br>
within the directory: **exercises \ week 3**. <br>
The workbook (PDF) containing most of the exercises cannot be uploaded due to Pluralsight ownership rights. <br>

### üí≠ My Thoughts
-In Progress- <br>
- The first commit for each repo should just include the project config files. The second commit should include the inital project code file(s). <br>
I made a mistake in this repo by including them both in the same inital commit, so I'll have to be careful not to make it again.
- Instead of using "Adding", "Updating", etc for the verbiage of my commits, I'd prefer to start using "Add", "Update", etc to match what Github shows me by default when adding commits to my README files. <br>
I think this will prepare me to use more uniform language which many other professionals have adapted to using (I think).

#### üîñ Citation
I wrote this README.md, but I did indeed use ChatGPT to give my initial framework and to learn markdown formatting. Therefore here is an APA Style Citation for it:  <br>
OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Oct 1 version) [Large language model]. https://chatgpt.com/ <br>

*I have to give credit where it's due, right?* <br>
